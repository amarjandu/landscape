# Landscape 🌵🌲🌾🌺🌿

This repo contains information that I've used to transfer sections of our yard
into one that primarily uses California Native species. This allows us to have
reduced water usage, support local fauna, and it should also look pretty swell.


# Sections ✂️

There are 4 sections that make up the front yard:

- Plumbing (See Hellscape)

 - [Hellscapes](hellscapes/README.md)

 - Main Lawn (Section Coming Soon)

 - Side Separation (Later)

To get a feel of the amount of labour it takes to finish of a section I decided 
to work on the smaller sections first, then work my way to the larger yard.
The main lawn was broken into 3 different sections that will be addressed in
different stages, this allows me to complete the more complex work in section 3
at a later time.

# Reducing Material Cost 💸

The biggest thing is don't use hardware stores to buy hardscape material, you
will probably find a better deal on rocks through a landscaping whole-seller.
The one that I use is [Clark`s Home and Garden](http://clarkshomeandgarden.com/).
The pricing is way more competitive. They even sell a higher quality weed barrier
at a more affordable price.

# Pro Advice

- Use a pickaxe to remove old grass
- Get the weed barrier from your rock yard, it will be cheaper, and better
  quality.
- Double layer the weed barrier if there is <3in of substrate on it.
