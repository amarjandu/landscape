# Landscape 🌵🌲🌾🌺🌿

This repo contains information that I've used to transfer sections of our yard
into one that primarily uses California Native species. This allows us to have
reduced water usage, support local fauna, and it should also look pretty swell.

# Permits / Building Code 🔍 📗

This is a reference for some landscaping building details in my area:

# Planning 📝

There are 5 main spaces to the front yard: 2 hellstrips (planting strip), a
separation between our and the neighbors property, a small section for plumbing,
then the primary front yard. To get a feel of the amount of labour it takes to
finish of a section I decided to work on the smaller hellscapes first, then work
my way to the larger yard.

# Reducing Material Cost 💸

The biggest thing is don't use hardware stores to buy hardscape material, you
will probably find a better deal on rocks through a landscaping whole-seller.
The one that I use is [Clark`s Home and Garden](http://clarkshomeandgarden.com/).
The pricing is way more competitive. They even sell a higher quality weed barrier
at a more affordable price.

# Pro Advice

- Use a pickaxe to remove old grass
- Get the weed barrier from your rock yard, it will be cheaper, and better
  quality.
- Double layer the weed barrier if there is <3in of substrate on it.
